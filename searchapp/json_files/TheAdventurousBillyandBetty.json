Although \u201cBilly\u201d was a very, very good boy, he was not a \u201cgoody-goody\u201d boy. He was a real country boy who loved to go fishing and swimming in the streams and ponds\u2014loved the birds and the woods and fields\u2014and'knew how to play all kinds of games with other little boys and girls. He was always happy and gay\u2014and he tried to make everybody else happy. And that was why everybody in this country town loved \u201cBilly.\u201d Down at the Grocery Store\u2014where Mother sent him very often, to bring home good things to eat \u2014 \"Billy\" used to help the Grocery Man to sweep and dust the Store, and arrange the packages and cans and bottles and other good things on the shelves. There were lots of different kinds of things in the Store, with the name\u2014L\u201c Van Camp\u2019s\u201d \u2014 on the labels; and \u201cBilly\u201d noticed these things more than any others because the first part of the name was the same as his own last name and because there was a big sign in the Grocer\u2019s window which read \u2018\u201cSomething Good for Every Meal\u2019\u2014Van Camp\u2019s\u201d. And, of course, like every little boy \u201cBilly\u201d just loved good things to eat; and best of all, he always wanted 4o eat only the food that was good for him. So, he used to eat lots of Van Camp\u2019s Baked Beans\u2014and Soup\u2014and Spaghetti\u2014and Pumpkin\u2014and Hominy\u2014and Milk\u2014and lots of other things; and he grew big and strong and healthy. One day, when \u201cBilly\u201d was hoeing corn, out in the field, and the sun was shining very hot, he felt so tired that he just had to lie down on the ground to rest\u2014and, before he knew it, he fell asleep. Then he had the most wonderful dream, about many thrilling adventures. that any little boy ever had.

She helped her Mamma around the house; and she made her Papa very happy, singing her little songs to him and reciting the little verses that she learned at school. Every morning, as soon as she woke up, she would run to the window and, looking out at the Rising Sun, would greet him with: \u201cGood-morning, Merry Sunshine, What makes you wake so soon? You scare away the little stars And drive away the moon!\u201d Then she would scamper off and1 go tippey-toe to Mamma's and Papa\u2019s room, to see it' they were awake. If she found they were still asleep, she would creep softly back to her bed and quietly read her little book until Papa and Mamma came in to the time\u2014and never bothered her parents. Just like Billy Van, this good little girl cleaned her teeth after every meal, kept her hands and face clean, behaved herself at the table, and ate only the things that were good for her.
