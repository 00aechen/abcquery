They were only too glad to do this, of course, and they had a fine time looking over the enormous supply of toys of every description. Mrs. Bright asked each child to make a rhyme about a favorite toy, promising that the one who made the best verse should receive as a prize the choice of the toys. After.they got home, the children, with the help of the elders, made up their rhymes. On the day of the twins' birthday'they all met at Mrs. Bright's and had great fun reading the verses.

He was a very, very good little boy who always obeyed his Mother and Father\u2014went to bed early at night and got up early in the morning\u2014cleaned his teeth before breakfast and after his meals\u2014 washed his face and hands, without being told\u2014fed the chickens and milked the cows\u2014and helped his Mother and Father around the house and the farm in the many, many ways that little boys should. Although \u201cBilly\u201d was a very, very good boy, he was not a \u201cgoody-goody\u201d boy. He was a real country boy who loved to go fishing and swimming in the streams and ponds\u2014loved the birds and the woods and fields\u2014and'knew how to play all kinds of games with other little boys and girls. He was always happy and gay\u2014and he tried to make everybody else happy. And that was why everybody in this country town loved \u201cBilly.\u201d Down at the Grocery Store\u2014where Mother sent him very often, to bring home good things to eat \u2014 \"Billy\" used to help the Grocery Man to sweep and dust the Store, and arrange the packages and cans and bottles and other good things on the shelves. There were lots of different kinds of things in the Store, with the name\u2014L\u201c Van Camp\u2019s\u201d \u2014 on the labels; and \u201cBilly\u201d noticed these things more than any others because the first part of the name was the same as his own last name and because there was a big sign in the Grocer\u2019s window which read \u2018\u201cSomething Good for Every Meal\u2019\u2014Van Camp\u2019s\u201d. And, of course, like every little boy \u201cBilly\u201d just loved good things to eat; and best of all, he always wanted 4o eat only the food that was good for him. So, he used to eat lots of Van Camp\u2019s Baked Beans\u2014and Soup\u2014and Spaghetti\u2014and Pumpkin\u2014and Hominy\u2014and Milk\u2014and lots of other things; and he grew big and strong and healthy. One day, when \u201cBilly\u201d was hoeing corn, out in the field, and the sun was shining very hot, he felt so tired that he just had to lie down on the ground to rest\u2014and, before he knew it, he fell asleep. Then he had the most wonderful dream, about many thrilling adventures. that any little boy ever had. He thought he saw fairies and goblins and elves \u2014and \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d\u2014and \u201cCinderella\u201d\u2014and \u201cJackand the Bean Stalk\u201d\u2014 and \u201cLittle Jack Horner\u201d\u2014and the \u201cBabes in the Woods\u201d \u2014and \u201cOld Mother Hubbard\u201d \u2014and all the other people and all the funny animals that live in the World of Fancy and Dreams.

Sometimes they called her \u201cLittle Sunshine,\u201d she was always such a dear, sweet, happy, good-natured, little girl\u2014and she brought happiness to everybody who knew her. She helped her Mamma around the house; and she made her Papa very happy, singing her little songs to him and reciting the little verses that she learned at school. Every morning, as soon as she woke up, she would run to the window and, looking out at the Rising Sun, would greet him with: \u201cGood-morning, Merry Sunshine, What makes you wake so soon? You scare away the little stars And drive away the moon!\u201d Then she would scamper off and1 go tippey-toe to Mamma's and Papa\u2019s room, to see it' they were awake. If she found they were still asleep, she would creep softly back to her bed and quietly read her little book until Papa and Mamma came in to the time\u2014and never bothered her parents. Just like Billy Van, this good little girl cleaned her teeth after every meal, kept her hands and face clean, behaved herself at the table, and ate only the things that were good for her. Betty used to like to look in the windows of the Big Grocery Stores\u2014and on their counters and shelves\u2014for she saw there the same kind of good things to eat that were always on her Mother\u2019s Pantry Shelf at home. They had the same kind of labels as the things-that Billy used to see in the little grocery store in the little country town\u2014and the same kind of a sign was in the windows of the Big Grocery Stores. It said: \u201c \u2018Something Good for Every Meal\u2019\u2014Van Camp\u2019s.\" She noticed that the last part of the name on the labels and on the sign was the same as her own last name\u2014and that pleased her very much. One hot, sun-shiny afternoon, when Betty was sitting out in the Park, reading a wonderful story book, she grew very tired and sleepy and, before she knew it, her little head drooped forward and she fell fast asleep.

They saw a funny looking boat tied up to the shore\u2014and they jumped into it to play they were out for a sail. But no sooner had they jumped aboard than a Irig wind blew and carried the boat far, far away over the ocean to the strange lands where the cannibals live! Many times the waves dashed over the sides of the boat and Billy and Betty thought surely they would be drowned. But Billy was a very good sailor for so young a boy and he managed to take the boat safely through the storm. Of course they had the Wonderful Lamp with them\u2014and it was lucky that they did, for they found nothing to eat in the cabin of the boat\u2014-and they would surely have starved to death without the aid of the Lamp. But drowning and starving were not the only dangers! As they came to one of the islands of this strange part of the world, a terrible-looking, big, brown cannibal jumped out from behind a rock on the shore\u2014ran down to the boat \u2014grabbed Billy and Betty\u2014carried them off into the woods \u2014and tied them to the stump of an old tree. Then the cannibal built a big fire under a huge pot of water and made ready to cook Billy and Betty\u2014and eat them! But Billy had a bright idea\u2014and he whispered to Betty not to be afraid. With that, he rubbed the Wonderful Lamp\u2014and behold! the ground was covered with all sorts of good things to eat\u2014all in bright dainty containers\u2014and every one with the same sort of a label. The cannibal was struck with fear\u2014and he fell to his knees and bowed his head down to the ground in front of Billy and Betty. When he had untied them, he called together all the men and women of his tribe and they all had a wonderful feast on the good food that Billy had provided. Then the cannibals made Billy and Betty their King and Queen \u2014 but that night, while the tribe was fast asleep, Billy and Betty stole away to the boat, escaped from the island, and sailed back to the welcome shores of America.

They were tired and hungry, so they sat down on a pile of soft leaves and began to wonder what they should do. Pretty soon the moon came up\u2014then Billy rubbed the Lamp and they had plenty to eat\u2014and that made them feel much-better and braver and more contented. As they looked around, they saw two big, bright, shiny eyes staring at them \u2014 and they wondered if this was the same woods where Little lted Riding Hood met the terrible Wolf. So, not to take any chances, they quickly climbed into the branches of a big tree, safe away from the Wolves and Foxes and all the other wild animals that prowl around the woods at night. And right beside them sat a friendly old Owl who broke the silence with\u2014 To Whit! To Whoo! Who are you? Billy and Betty told them\u2014and the wise old Owl winked an eye and told them he thought they were very wise, too, to get up in the tree away from harm.

His land is full of india-rubber trees, and when rubber is wanted, he taps the trees by making a cut in the bark from the root to the lowest branch, and various other cuts running from it at right angles. Then down the long cut runs the sap, which drips into a calabash. When this is filled, it is placed over a fire, the heat of which causes the liquid rubber to thicken, and thus become ready for trade. The Yorubas must not be called savages, and are skilful blacksmiths, brass, leather, and glass workers, weavers, and canoe builders.

Usually they clothe themselves in ox-hides, leopard-skins, and blankets, but their cup of joy is full if they can dress up in the old red coat of a soldier. They are a very warlike people. Under their chief Cetewayo they fought against the British, who were well armed and well trained, yet could not conquer them for quite a long time. Amongst those who were killed in this Zulu War was the Prince Imperial, son of Napoleon the Third. At the time of his death he was serving as an officer in the British army.- Many of the Zulus still live in tribes, and have villages of beehive-shaped houses.
